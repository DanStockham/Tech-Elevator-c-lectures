Since its original landmark publication in 1980, A People''s History of the United States has been chronicling American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official version of history taught in schools—with its emphasis on great men in high places—to focus on the street, the home, and the, workplace.

Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People''s History of the United States is the only volume to tell America''s story from the point of view of—and in the words of—America''s women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country''s greatest battles—the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women''s rights, racial equality—were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.

Covering Christopher Columbus''s arrival through President Clinton''s first term, A People''s History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.', CAST(18.99 AS Decimal(4, 2)), N'ABC-1234.jpg', CAST(22.80 AS Decimal(5, 2)), 1)

And that''s why we put such care and pride into our Abraham Lincoln Little Thinker doll. Abe stands a towering 12 inches tall and sports his trademark stovepipe hat. He''s well constructed with exacting attention to every detail. They just don''t make Republicans like they used to. Thankfully, we do.
